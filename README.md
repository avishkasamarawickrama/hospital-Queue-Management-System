 Smart Queue Management System for Hospital
A system that digitally manages patient queues, reducing wait times and improving hospital efficiency.


 Patient (User) :
 Online Queue Booking: Patients can book a queue number remotely for different departments (OPD, Lab, etc.).
 Real-Time Queue Updates: Patients can see their estimated wait time dynamically (using AJAX).
 Smart Priority System: Elderly and emergency patients get higher priority.
 Doctor Selection: Patients can choose a specific doctor based on availability.
 SMS/Email Notifications: Get notified when their turn is near.
 Patient Dashboard: View past visits, prescriptions, and upcoming appointments.

 Kiosk Token Booking: Book a token from a self-service machine at the hospital.

*A Kiosk Token Booking System allows patients to book a queue number from a self-service machine (kiosk) at the hospital. Instead of waiting in a long queue to get a token from a receptionist, patients can use a touchscreen kiosk to generate their own queue number.

 Admin (Doctor & Staff) :
 Doctor Dashboard: See the current queue, mark patients as “Consulted” or “Referred”.
 Manage Queue Order: Reorder queue if needed (e.g., prioritize emergencies).
 Monitor Wait Times: View average patient wait times and optimize hospital flow.
 Assign Doctors: Assign patients to available doctors dynamically.
 Generate Reports: View hospital queue trends, patient visit history, and service analytics.
 Role-Based Access:

Doctors: Manage patient queues and mark consultations.
Admins: Manage hospital settings, doctors, and queues.



 Additional Features (If Time Permits):
 Doctor Availability Scheduling – Doctors can set their available hours.
 Patient History Tracking – Patients can view their previous visits.
